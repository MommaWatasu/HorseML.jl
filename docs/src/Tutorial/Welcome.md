# Welcome to HorseML!

## Easy-to-use and very functional ML Library
HorseML is the ML Library for JuliaLang. With this package, you can build various models such as regression, classification, and decition tree, etc. 

In addition, each function is designed to be easy to use,  so it's good for those who want to learn machine learning with Julia!

Please try using HorseML!

### Development Goals
HorseML aims to be such a library.
- less deps
I don't like deps. so it's basic ,but I'm trying to make it as few deps as possible.
- Easy-to-use API
No matter how advanced the functions are, it's hard to use complicated things. I'm implementing it so that it's easy to understand.
- Equipped with interesting functions
At the moment, I haven't reached this far because I have developed basic functions, but in the feature, we are thinking of implementing experimental functions that have never existed in other ML libraries!

## Installation
From the Julia REPL, type ] to enter the Pkg REPL mode and run.
```
pkg> add HorseML
```

## About this Tutorial
This tutorial is made as easy to understand as possible by demonstrating examples of almost functions of HorseML. The code used as an example basically works if you run it in one Jupyter Notebook for each chapter.
