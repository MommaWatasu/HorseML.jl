# Tree

## Decision Tree
From here, let's build a slightly more advanced model.
The first is decision tree analysis.
This model creates a tree structure classifier by creating nodes that recursively divide data.

### Train
Unlike other classifiers, this model doesn't require the data used for training to be in OneHot format, and it can be used as labels.
```
using HorseML.Preprocessing

using HorseML.Tree
using HorseML.Tree: fit!, predict

data = Matrix(dataloader("iris"))
x, t = data[:, 1:4], data[:, 5]

model = DecisionTree()
fit!(model, x, t)
```

### Visualize
Some of you may have seen it on HorseML's README.md. Let's visualize the trained decision tree using Graphviz!
First, let's make a dot file to visualize with Graphviz by the [`MV`](@ref) function.
```
MV("/home/ubuntu/Tree.dot", model, rounded = true, bgcolor = "#4aae4a", label = "Tree Model")
```
Next, it's done by visualizing it using Graphviz!
```
#In command line, if you haven't installed Graphviz, install with `sudo apt add graphviz`
$ dot -Tpng -o /home/ubuntu/Tree.png /home/ubuntu/Tree.dot
```
Let's look at Tree.png...

## RandomForest
RandomForest generates some DecisionTree(like [`SVC`](@ref)).
What is different from the decision tree is that you need to specify the number of decision trees to generate.
```
model = RandomForest(10)

fit!(model, x, t)
```
Visualization can be done in the same way.
```
paths = ["/home/ubuntu/tree$i.dot", for i in 1 : 10]
MV(paths, model, rounded = true, bg = "#4aae4a", label = "Forest Model")
```
```
$ dot -Tpng -o /home/ubuntu/tree1.png /home/ubuntu/tree1.dot
$ dot -Tpng -o /home/ubuntu/tree2.png /home/ubuntu/tree2.dot
$ dot -Tpng -o /home/ubuntu/tree3.png /home/ubuntu/tree3.dot

!!! tips
    Random Forest is implemented for multi-threaded learning, so you can speed up learning by specifying the `-t` option when you start Julia.
